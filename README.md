# Thesis R work
 Thesis R work minus the data for public viewing. 
 
Click (here)[https://github.com/maxo16/thesis_r_work_no_data/blob/main/Consolidated_work/Consolidated%20work.Rmd] for the R markdown containing the consolidated R work. While this is the bulk of the analysis put together to allow for the quick manipulation of user defined parameters and their effects on the statistical model, it does not include a good bit of the data preprocessing. These were steps that only needed to be done once, and were also time consuming, and thus the data was saved as R objects and loaded duriing the runnnig of this markdown.
